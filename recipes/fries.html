    <h3>French fries, or simply fries, also known as chips, and finger chips, are batonnet or julienne-cut deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin. They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>garlic salt</li>
        <li>onion salt</li>
        <li>paprika</li>  
        <li>salt</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
        <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
        <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
