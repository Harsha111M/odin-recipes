    <h3>Aglio e olio is a deliciously simple Italian dish of fresh garlic, olive oil, and Parmesan cheese tossed with freshly cooked spaghetti pasta.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>olive Oil</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Ground pepper</li>
        <li>parsley</li>
        <li>cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta.</li>
        <li>Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.</li>
        <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
    </ol>
